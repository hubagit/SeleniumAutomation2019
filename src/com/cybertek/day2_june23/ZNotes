HELLO!
No assessment discussion, only selenium!

Please work on WARM UP TASK!
It's in announcement.

For mac just chromedriver
For windows chromedriver.exe

What is Selenium?
At least something happens when we run code.

driver.get("URL") <-- to open some website
Usually, all tests start from opening a website.


WebDrvier is an interface. ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver implements this interface.



In automation, people use a lot Thread.sleep(time); to achieve synchronization.
 What is synchronization? Is when your script and web application synced.Because, selenium doesn't
 wait by default. For instance: if browser loads page to slow, and some button is not visible or
 displayed yet, and your selenium script is trying to click on the button - your code will fail,
 because selenium will not wait for appearance of that button by default.

 Thread.sleep() is not
 directly related to selenium, it's coming from java. It suspends current thread execution for
 specific amount of time. It's the worst way to achieve synchronization because regardless or
 website response time, your wait time will be fixed.

Interview story: When I joined my current project, out framework had a lot of Thread.sleep().
Me as, a super hero changed all these hard coded wait to explicit waits. By doing this,
we reduced execution time twice(haha).

class InterruptedException extends Exception {

}
we can put either InterruptedException or Exception for Thread.sleep() catch statement,
because InterruptedException class extends Exception class. Also, we can use Throwable.


Failed
Expected title: Practice$
Actual title: Practice

We are getting actual result from web page.


getTitle() - returns title of the page.
In the source code, in HTML, it looks like this :
<title>I am title!</title>
Value in between tags is a title of the page.

Selenium reads this value with a help of getTitle() method.

driver.close() - to close browser at the end of execution.

break till 3:12 EST!==========================================

Exceptions - is your burden in selenium.


USually people at work type FYI. (for your information)

So FYI, at work I used maximize() not fullscreen().

driver.getPageSource();

Story: At work, I had to use InternetExplorer for testing. There was one page, where I had click on button
 and then modal dialog was displayed. Because application was not optimized for chrome, only for ie,
 I couldn't even open that window in chrome to inspect source code. It doesn't provide these features
 to inspect source code. I couldn't read that modal dialog with chrome or any other browser to inspect and
 create locators. So in order to read the source of code of that page, I used method getPageSource() then
 I was able to read it and based on that info created locators.

locator - is like an address of element on the page. Selenium use locators to to find elements on the page.

Main reason to use this method - when you need to read a source of the page. Because you can store it
somewhere (let's say in string) for some kind of verifications
/manipulations operations.

if you will put incorrect URL, you will get

Exception in thread "main" org.openqa.selenium.InvalidArgumentException: invalid argument

driver.navigate().to() Load a new web page in the current browser window.

According to the selenium documentation there is no difference between get() and navigate().to()

navigate() method allowing the driver to access the browser's history and to navigate to a given URL.

You can practice , but don't try to do DDOS attack.

Behind a scenes, navigate(),to() calls get() method.

driver.getTitle() - for page title
driver.getCurrentUrl() - to read current website url
driver.navigate().to() - to go to some website in the same window
driver.navigate().back() - to navigate to the previous website in the browser history.
driver.navigate().forward() - to navigate to the latest opened page, for example after you did navigate back()
you can come back to the website with navigate().forward().

driver.navigate().refresh(); - to refresh/reload the page.
============================================================
WebDriver is an interface. We use it to interact with web browser. Selenium talks with browser directly
through HTTP requests.

get() method to open url
close() to close browser
getTitle() to read title
navigate() to browse in browser history
navigate().to() to open new url in the same window
navigate().back() to navigate to the previous web site.
navigate().forward() we can use after navigate().back() to come back to the last opened web site.
navigate().refresh() to refresh/reload the page
getPageSource() to get HTLM code of the page
maximize() to maximize window
getCurrentUrl() to get URl of current page
fullscreen() to open browser in the fullscreen mode

Thread.sleep(time); to put on hold current test execution.
